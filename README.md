More stuff to come here as we go

Current status:
run docker-compose up fails running migrations
if run again after fail migration and seeds are ran.
On attampts to try docker-compose up --build the drop table fails due to db constraint even if documentation tells that this should work.
Fix is to run docker-comppose down and start all over again.

There are still some trouble with getting the connections to the express server to work on my machine
